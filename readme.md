## Horizontal Rules'

I will be releasing any work I personally do that uses the electron framework.
I'll start with the first app demo I made with Electron for my app development class back in uni.

#### Budget Plus App (https://github.com/Am3nd/Budget-App-public)

 
Here is a template I made that is firebase ready and uses sqlite3 for a local database. I always loved using sqlite3 since it doesn't require the user to have SQL installed and you don't have to include SQL as part of the install process and it helps reduce the install file size as well. It definitely has its drawbacks and you do need to be careful about what you use it for.

#### Electron template with updates (https://github.com/Am3nd/Electron-Template-public)


Here are some packages I use with my template That I set to public, useful for accessing sqlite3 and my custom logger
